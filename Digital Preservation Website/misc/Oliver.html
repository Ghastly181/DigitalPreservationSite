<h2>The Ethical concerns of digital preservation</h2>

<h3> Concerns regarding Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>There may be some concerns regarding the involvement of intellectual property when digital media is being archived. In my opinion, the risk of violating intellectual property may be inevitable, as there are those already partaking in acts of piracy through media. In a roundabout way, this contributes to a sort of digital archival, though through illegal or shady means to acquire such media. However, I believe intellectual property should only matter if the copyright holder is making use of said property. This comes with a flaw however, as there may be some property holders that may want to keep certain media and properties to bank on and use in the future. </p>

<h3>Concerns on the archival process </h3>
<p>There are concerns that may arise around the archival process. One such concern would be in the authenticity towards the original media. As time goes on, would the preserved version of the media be the same as the original copy? One example of this happening is in the many rereleases of the original Star Wars trilogy, wherein many changes that were both major and minor, were implemented at the creator George Lucas’s behest to improve upon the original due to the time of which it was produced in. Changes such as extra work done in computer generated imagery to add or replace certain characters, to replacing voices and cast for certain characters to line up with later films. Some dedicated fans have taken to try and restore these original works, such as the Harmy’s Despecialized Edition, a fan reconstruction project which aims to present the three films in its original theatrical cut, which takes various sources from the many rereleases and versions of the movie. In my opinion, this is acceptable only if the original cut of the films is still accessible to the masses. By extension, the original finished work of any product made should still be available for anyone to view and access, which holds copyright holders accountable to the preservations of such works.</p>

<h3>Moral concerns</h3>
<p>In the case of digital preservation, all things that are relevant to today’s society must be archived. Not only does that include movies, games, and websites, but also that which may be reprehensible. Examples such as manifestos of violent people and world affairs and conflicts recorded due to the accessibility of such technology. All these examples and many more must be recorded to paint a picture on the time on which they take place in, digital works that define culture and generations of people, so that the future peoples can look back on these times, just as we would look back on past events and history of our people on this world.</p>
