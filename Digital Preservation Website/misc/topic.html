<h1>Digital Preservation</h1>


</ul><p>The topic that we have chosen to make our website about is Digital preservation. Digital Preservation is the act of preserving current and past artifacts digitally to ensure that later on in the future they will be accessible for study by the public. This is important to ensure that various works of art and cultural heritage stay intact for future generations to view and experience in some form. Without Digital Preservation it would be nearly impossible for future generations to see how the world looks digitally and physically at this time. There are many companies and organizations aiming to archive the internet and other media such as books, movies and programs to try and preserve the cultural artifacts of our time and of the past. There are various opportunities risks and choices regarding digital preservation that we discuss throughout this website that you should be able to access via the links on the left of the page.</p>
