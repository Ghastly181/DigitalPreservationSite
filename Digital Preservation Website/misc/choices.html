<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><p>There are a couple choices that need to be made concerning Digital Preservation that are somewhat interconnected. Most of them relating to the feasibility of the archival of various materials.</p>
<p><h3>Is it plausible to archive everything we can?</h3></p>
<p>If we were to archive <b>literally everything</b> that was avalible then we would quickly face storage space concerns due to the immense amount of data being stored. 
If we run out of space, we will be unable to archive anything else.<br> Even hypothetically assuming we dont need to worry about storage space due to future developments in storage capabilities, is it possible or more importantly, is it <b>feasible</b> to archive every single state of a digital resource?<br>
After all, websites change quite a lot over time, and sometimes change very frequently in a short span of time. Is it plausible to archive all of the different changes the site may undergo?<br> Is it reasonable to store every single change that is made to a website, every single minor ui change and every spelling correction made?<br> The sheer number of different states of a different website that would need to be archived would be absurd especially when you consider how many websites would need to have the exact same treatment.<br> According to (Siteefy, 2022) There are <b>over 1.17 billion</b> websites in the world, with <b>over 2 hundred million</b> currently active, and around <b>252 thousand</b> new websites being created <b>every day</b>.<br> In the case of software programs, would we archive all complete versions of a program? Or would we only archive the base program and archive the update packages seperately to be added on individually to reach the correct version?<br> Either way, archiving all this would result in an immeasurable amount of data being stored. In the case that we archive all this it would be near impossible to index all this to find something. This leads into the next point.</p>

<p><h3>What is actually worth being archived?</h3></p>

<p>Some things that we archive may not have any worth being archived, maybe due to being a near duplicate of something else that has already been archived, rendering other copies <b>redundant</b> or by being of no cultural, philosophical, educational or artistic value. But in that case <b>how do we decide what constitutes as cultural, philosophical, educational, or artistic value?</b> Any decisions regarding such things would be <b>unavoidably biased</b> to our own preferences, it would be highly difficult to objectively decide what is worth being archived. For example some people may consider videogames as not having any cultural, philosophical, educational or artistic value due to bias or inexperiece with the medium and as such choose not to archive them. But others would consider videogames as having great value in the various catagories and having value in the form of a interactive media to show ideas in greater depth and place heavy importance in archiving games.</p>

<p><h3>Some digital artifacts may be unable to be archived authentically or legally.</h3></p>

<p>Various digital artifacts may have conditions that would make them <b>extremely difficult to authentically archive</b> them, such as sites with excessive customization. There are also some sites or applications that may rely on constantly changing databases or external services to work properly making it impossible to archive them authentically as if they are archived. Some applications or games are locked by <b>digital right management (DRM)</b> software making it so that in order for the program to function it is required to link up to an external server online to have any functionality. This is usually done to protect copyrighted works from being distributed in the public space without paying for the program. Circumvention of these DRMs is considered a <b>criminal act</b>. However many of these official DRM servers go down after the program loses popularity or has been out for a certain amount of time, leaving the program </b>unusable without a link</b> to an offical server. Archival of such programs would be <b>pointless</b> without the server for it to link up to. In the past people have made unofficial servers to restore functions to these programs. However the legality of these servers ranges from <b>dubious to illegal</b> and they are unlikly to stand up to any attention from the original producers of the program. As such the law is extremely limiting to archival of these programs.</p>
