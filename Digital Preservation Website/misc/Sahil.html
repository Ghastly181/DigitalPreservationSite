<h2>The Ethical concerns of digital preservation</h2>

<h3> Concerning Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>There are some concerns over the violation of Intellectual Property when archiving media for use in the future. In my personal opinion I feel that Intellectual Property should only matter as long as the holder of the rights is making use of them or if they are still around to weigh in on disputes of Intellectual Property. For example some of the media that would be archive may last much longer than the company does. In the case that the company or entity that holds rights to the media goes under but the media is still around, the media should be considered under fair use and thus free to be spread for free. Or another example, a game is made by a company and is up on their market place for 5 years, after that they take the game down from every single website and never make use of the property again, now the only place that the property is avalible is the archive. Should this still be considered their property if they are not making any use of it or distributing it? In my opinion if a intelectual property is not used or distributed for a certain period of time then the company or entity holding the rights should lose them and have the property made free use for the public. If the Intellectual Property is being actively used and distributed then the entity holding it can keep the rights as long as they continue to do so.</p>

<h3>Misinformation, and Access Restrictions</h3>
<p>When concerning much older archived materials in the future, there would be no comparable source material to find the original and as such we would face the threat of people defacing information in the archives and there being no way to restore the original material. In order to prevent this we would likely have to have only certain authorized people able to change data in the archives. But then we would get rid of the spirit of a collaborative community effort to archive our culture and as I mentioned in the choices page it is likely that if we limit the archival to authorized agents they would likely be biased in what they archive and change as opposed to the community effort making it difficult to squash out different viewpoints.</p>

<h3>Moral concerns of archival</h3>
<p>If we are to archive all relevant media, along with all the good stuff we would have to archive the bad stuff as well. This is because such things are important to fully understand our culture and present situations in the future. Such as manifestos of school shooters, hate speeches of world leaders, all the really bad stuff that some may think needs to be forgotten and left in the past. I believe that all this stuff should be archived as well in order for future generations to be able to look back on and learn from. After all as the famous saying goes, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” - George Santayana 1905 </p>
<p>These are all the Ethical Concerns I thought would be relevent to this topic. </p>
