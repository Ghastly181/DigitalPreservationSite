<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><p>Where there are opportunities, there are also risks involved in the process of digital preservation. The fact that digital media is being preserved holds the inevitability of technology being obsolete. This may be due to hardware and/or software obsolescence, which requires legacy systems to be maintained, which may come with extra work involved. This of course leads to the opportunity of allowing others to develop an upkeep of legacy systems and framework. Obsolescence of hardware and software may also degrade over time, as data can be lost or corrupted due to newer operating systems or time in general. The rate at which data is created is at an astonishing rate, far more than the capacity the world has for storing digital media, which can lead to the loss of data. One major risk is due to copyright laws, which can get in the way of acquiring, restoring and accessing data. Certain works, when in the process of being preserved, may infringe upon copyright, sometimes due to unauthorized work, unless the material is in public domain or exceptions are made in copyright law or legislations. This carries the risk of breaking laws, end-user license agreements and the terms of service of products produced in the digital landscape that stay within the digital confines. There are also risks to long time storage of preserved media such as "bit rot", the gradual decay of computer data. this usually occurs when the bits of a storage medium lose their charge, whether its a solid state drive losing an electrical charge due to problems with insulation, a magnetic medium like a hard disk or magnetic tape having bits lose magnetic orientation, or an optical disk physically breaking down. This is a significant danger to long term storage of archived media, especially those that go unchecked for a long period of time.</p>
