<h2>Ethical position of digital preservation</h2>

<h3>Measure of personal information, intellectual property.</h3>
<p>digital materials facing the copyright challenging and often have grey areas. Currently with digital materials it is hard to chase its origin, it will not document or being supervise of who download. Therefore, the chance of anyone can be accessed with those digital materials, makes it unable to measure.</p>

<h3>Lack of oversight of responsibility</h3>
<p>As we mentioned before, digital materials online not able to track its origin, without oversight when problem accuse, there won’t be anyone who need to take responsibility. Also for doing digital preservation requires many different process, such as format migration, system different iterations, via from software to software, hardware to hardware and more, therefor data loss during such process will be hard to define rather it’s a human responsibility or machine error. </p>

<h3>Misinformation and fakes information</h3>
<p>Due to lack of oversight and measurement of digital materials online, it is facing the problem of anyone able to access to those digital, therefore those digital materials can be very easy to be manipulated.  </p>

<h3>Moral use of data and resources</h3>
<p>The purpose of using or access digital materials is also hard to be measure. Digital preserve is for different purposed used by different stakeholder, therefore digital materials value can remain findable, accessible, readable and usable. However, each stakeholder has different purpose, moral or not morally.  </p>
<p>Finally, thought those issues, we can understand the importance of ethical position in digital preservation, and is important for oneself act ethically, professionally while dealing digital preservation.  </p>
